# 𝔯𝔢𝔠𝔬𝔫-𝔰𝔱𝔯𝔲𝔠𝔱 / utility types

This is a library of utility types that supercharge your TypeScript development.

## 🤨 Why?

Use of these types assists in creating isomorphic functions that reveal their
return value prior to compilation. This innovation assists with AI powered tools
like [Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot). Giving the AI more context
than it would have otherwise.

## Installation

```shell
npm install @recon-struct/utility-types
