# 𝔯𝔢𝔠𝔬𝔫-𝔰𝔱𝔯𝔲𝔠𝔱 / utility types

A repository of TypeScript utility types.

## 🤨 Why?

Use of these types assists in creating isomorphic functions that reveal their
return value prior to compilation. This innovation assists with AI powered tools
like [Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot). Giving the AI more context
than it would have otherwise.
